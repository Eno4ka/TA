His eyes upon your face,
His hand upon your hand,
His lips caress your skin,
It's more than I can stand!

Feelings I can't fight,
You're free to leave me,
But just don't deceive me
And please,
Believe me when I say,
I love you.

Feelings I can't fight,
You're free to leave me,
But just don't deceive me
And please,
Believe me when I say,
I love you.

Why does my heart cry?
Feelings I can't fight,
